## README 

This practical has been designed to be run on google colab but could also but run locally using Jupyter notebook.


To run on Colab (preferred):
- Add practical to the healthcare_practicals folder made for the previous practical. 
- Make sure you also add the prepare_data.py script
- Open P2.ipynb in google colab 
- Run initial cell to mount drives

To run locally:
- It has only been tested for my environment which contained: Python 3.8.11, PyTorch 1.10.2, Numpy 1.21.2, Matplotlib 3.5.1
- Open jupyter notebook.
- Delete the first cell to mount the file
- The image paths and data paths will need changing to the local path
